This project involves making a google drive clone where different features and functionalities of google drive are integrated into the application. The application uses html, css and javascript to achieve the desired functionalities. The main objective of making the clone is to explore how the different features of google drive works and how they are created. This project is mainly using the basic front-end design. The application thus created uses firebase as the database where all the data entered into the application will be stored in the firestore database as well as the storage of firebase. The process of storage will occur in realtime. We can upload files by clicking on the upload file option in our application in the same way as we can upload a file in the actual google drive. As soon as the file is created it will keep a record in both the firebase and the web application.

A new feature has been added to this application which is the authentication of user. The user can now login into the application using their g-mail only and then can upload their files into the drive.
